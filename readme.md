# NumPy Fundamentals

This repository documents my step-by-step learning of NumPy fundamentals
with a focus on data preprocessing and machine learning readiness.

## Topics Covered
- Array creation and shapes
- Indexing, slicing, and boolean masking
- Reshaping and axis-based operations
- Broadcasting
- Array stacking, splitting, insertion, and deletion
- Handling NaN and infinite values

## Goal
Build a strong foundation for pandas, scikit-learn, and PyTorch.

This repository is part of my long-term ML learning journey.
